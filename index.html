     <p id="p2" >One of CRP’s most successful programs is our computer skills training course, which is taught and organized by volunteers from the community. Beneficiaries learn to use computers for work and fun. Computer skills are invaluable and grow increasingly in demand each year. These skills also allow people to reach out and stay in touch with family members or friends who may have gotten resettled or separated.</p>

         <p id="p3" >We know some kids struggle to focus for long periods. So the partners we recommended offer group tutoring in two parts - an ‘hour of power’ one-hour tutoring session; filled with learning, challenges and fun. Then to reinforce knowledge and keep students on track they assign weekly practice to complete before the next learning session.It will also help in developing the communication skills</p>
